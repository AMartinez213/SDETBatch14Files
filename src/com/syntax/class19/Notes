"this" Keyword:
    "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". It is used in many places. For example if we have same name instance
     and a local variable we can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a
     constructor inside another constructor.
Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1. It allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
    2. If we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor
       inside another constructor by writing "this()"

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
    There are 4 types of inheritance:
    1. Single Inheritance:
      -In single inheritance we have One Parent and One Child Class.
      Employee-->Person
    2.Multi-Level Inheritance:
      In multiple-level inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather-->father-->son-->
      grandson
    3.Hierarchical inheritance:
      One Parent class and multiple direct child classes.
    4.Multiple inheritance:
      One child class can directly inherit from multiple from parent classes.

Why should we learn inheritance?
    It allows to reduce the duplicate code.
What is the syntax?
    We can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.
