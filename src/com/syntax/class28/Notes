Maps in Java:
    Maps are datastructures that allows us to store key value pairs.
Why we should use Maps?
    Whenever we have to store key value pairs instead of using arrays or ArrayLists we should use Maps because they
    provide very good performance and have built-in methods to process the data
What is the syntax of Maps?
    Map<DataTypeOfKey,DataValueOfValue> anyName=new MapClass<>();
    for example if we have to store fruits and thier prices we will do something like this
    HashMaps<String,Double> fruit=new HashMap<>();
Types of Maps:
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    This is the most widely used type of map reason, it is faster and occupies less memory.
    We should always use HashMap if there are no requirements for insertion order or sorting.
LinkedHashMap:
    LinkedHashMap keeps the insertion order, but it takes a little more memory than HashMap and is a little slower.
TreeMap:
    TreeMap sorts the data in natural order (ABC123) but insertion is very slow. It takes more memory to keep the data
    in sorted order.
File Handling:
    Reading writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling
    read data from any files on any computer:
