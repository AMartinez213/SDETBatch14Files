Java Class 8

Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

for loop - when we know number of repetitions/iterations in advance

    for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){

    code to repeat;
    }

while loop and do while -> then executes code

while(boolean condition) {
    code to repeat;
}

do while executes code -> then checks condition
do{
    code to repeat;
}while(boolean condition);
