FileHandling in Java:
    Reading writing and manipulating files using java code is called FileHandling
Why should we learn FileHandling;
    1)When we perform data driven testing we need to store data in files.
    2)Storing critical data like userNames and passwords inside the code is bad practice because when we push the code
    that info will also be pushed with it, to avoid this we use properties files.
    3)Sometimes data can be huge in GBs and it is very bad practice to push GBs to gitHub
How can we read data from a file?
    1)We need to know the location(path) of the file.
    2)Navigate to that location where the file is stored
    3)We need a special class/software that can help us read/write to that file.
