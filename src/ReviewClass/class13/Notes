HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. Hashtable is thread safe. It uses synchronization to achieve thread safety
    and because of this it is slow as compared to HashMap.
Why we should not use Hashtable:
    As a tester its very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if we dont write multithreaded code but
    still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benifit.
Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map

Important concept for your coding tests:
if else conditions
loops
arrays
String class methods
ArrayList
Maps

important concepts for verbal interviews:
OOPS

for Framework:
1)How Classes work for example how to create a class how to declare instance variables how to use them inside a method
2)Go through all the concepts of methods
3)Types of variables like instances static(you will be using heavyly)
4)Inheritance
5)ArrayList and Maps

FileHandling in Java:
    Reading, writing, and manipulating files.

Why we should learn about file handling?
     1)We don't store sensitive data inside the code it might get exposed when we push the code to GitHub.
     2)Hardcoding the data or creditnetials in code is very bad practice because for any reason if you have to change
     the credentials or the data you will have to change it everywhere which will take alot of time.
     3)When we have to perform data drive testing we use a lot of data to perform this type of testing it is not feasible
     to put all of that data in code.
Steps to read from any file in java:
    1)First we need the location(path)
    2)Use a class to navigate to that location(for example FileInputStream)
    3)We need a class that can help us read/write data to that special type of file for example
