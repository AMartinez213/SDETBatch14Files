Exceptions:
    It's an unwanted behaviour that occurs at runtime and disturbs the normal flow of a program.
Why we should learn about exception?
    1)We can use exception to figure out the exact line of code and can also get an explanation about that error.
    2)When we are building applications for other users like Google Chrome, Discord, Zoom, etc. we can use Exception
    handling to improve the user experience when we handle exception application no longer terminate abruptly.
    3)To convert complex system generated error messages to something that everyone can understand.
What is the Syntax:
    We can handle exceptions using Try Catch block
    We can also utilize finally block and we use some new keywords like throw and throw.
Try-Catch block:
    try{
    // the code that might cause some problems
    }catch (the name of the class who's exception we are expecting){

    //Back-Up code or the code that we want to execute in case the code in try block fails
    }
    finally{
    // the code that we want to execute no matter what happens in try or catch block
    // for example closing the critical system resources like files releasing database connection etc.
    }
Throw keyword:
    We use throw keyword to through the exceptions
Throws keyword:
    When we want to avoid writing a try catch block we can use throws keyword with method header to throw this
    responsibility to the caller of the method. It bad we should avoid it if we know how to handle an exception.
