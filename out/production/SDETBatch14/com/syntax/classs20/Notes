What is inheritance:
    Its a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance:
    It helps use avoid code duplication.
    It helps us save space.
    It helps us improve the execution speed.
What is the syntax?
    We use the extends keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields and methods
    while declaring the class.
Types of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them in classes
    -Single
    -Multi-Level
    -Hierarchical
    -Multiple(It is not supported by classes in java
Single inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and one child class in inheritance it is called single inheritance not widely used
Multi-Level inheritance:
    One top leve land one base class and many intermediate classes. For example A<B<C<D.
Hierarchical inheritance:
    When we have one parent class and multiple child classes it's called Hierarchical inheritance.
Multiple inheritanceL
    One child and multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in java.
