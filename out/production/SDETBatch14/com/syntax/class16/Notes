Types of variables in java with respect to their scope:
There are three types of variables in Java with respect to their scope. Local Instance and Static

Local Variables:
    If a variable is declared inside a block of code like method, loop,
    if-condition they are called local variables.
Up-Side of a local variable:
    The upside is they exist for a very short amount of time in the memory.
    Which means other programs in our computer can use that memory.
Down-Side of local variables:
    Their scope is very limited. Only inside that block in which they're created.
    We cant access them outside that block.
When to use:
    We should always try to use local variable over instance variables whenever it is possible

Instance variables:
    The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of block of code are called instance variables.
Up-Side of a Instance variables:
    We can use these variable inside any block of code that is inside that class.
Down-Side of instance variables:
    They occupy the memory for longer than a local variable.
When to use:
    -When we need to share a value between two or more methods then we should go with the instance variable
    -When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and its possible that all the objects can have
    a different value for that variable

Static variables:
    An instance variable with static keyword is called static variable.
Up-Side of a Static variables:
    We can share data across the objects with the help of static variables.
Down-Side: of Static variables:
    They occupy the memory for the longest period
When to use:
    When we want to share something across all the methods.

Access Modifier:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class its in.
    There are four access levels and three access modifier.
    These are only applicable to instance or static variables. Can't be used with local variables.

Private:
    Private is the most restricted one. If we use private keyword with any variable or method.
    We can oly access it within the same class.
When we should use private access modifier:
    We should always try to create variable as private.
    The data that we store inside the private variable is secured.

Default Access modifier:
    -Default is not a keyword. Whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or public
     Java assigns default access level to those variables or methods.
    -The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed within the same class or in any other
     class that is present inside the same package.

Public access modifier:


**Only one public class can be in a file**
