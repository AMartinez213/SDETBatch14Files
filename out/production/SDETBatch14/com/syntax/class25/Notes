Collection Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which helps us process the data efficiently
    and easily.
Why we should learn about it:
    1) It's very flexible
    2) Provide ready-made methods that we can juse use.
What is the Syntax?
    It's similar how we create the object of any class but we use <> to specify the name of the class who's objects we
    are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections Framework:
    1) Collection framework does not work with primitive datatype(Solution is use wrapper classes).

Note: Frequently asked in interviews!!!!!
Note: Wrapper class uses 4x more memory than a primitive.

Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.
Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.
            int num = 10;
    //      Boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type
    //      Integer wrappedNum = Integer.valueOf(num);
Auto-Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
    Integer wrappedNum = 10;
Un-Boxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type by explicitly calling a method.
    //      Un-Boxing converting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
    //      int num2=wrappedNum.intValue();
Auto-Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper to corresponding primitive automatically by just assigning the value.
    Integer wrappedNum=new Integer(10);
    int num2=wrappedNum;
