Collection Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which helps us process the data efficiently
    and easily.
Why we should learn about it:
    1) It's very flexible
    2) Provide ready-made methods that we can juse use.
What is the Syntax?
    It's similar how we create the object of any class but we use <> to specify the name of the class who's objects we
    are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections Framework:
    1) Collection framework does not work with primitive datatype(Solution is use wrapper classes).

Wrapper Classes:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.
Boxing:
    Converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type.
